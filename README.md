RedBall Inifinity

Description

Game inspired by the famous game "Bounce", from the 90s. A simple recreation to demonstrate all the skills that were learned in Bootcamp.
In my game, the ball has to jump over boxes and throns in order to catch rings to earn more points.
If the ball lands on the thorns, the game is over.
