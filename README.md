Description

Game inspired by the famous game "Bounce", from the 90's. A simple recreation to demonstrate all the skills that were learned in Bootcamp.
In my game the ball has to jumps over boxes and throns. In order to catch rings to earn more points.
If the ball lands on the thorns, it the game is over.
